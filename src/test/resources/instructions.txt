The purpose of this assignment is for us to get a better idea of how you think,
organize code, and tackle the problems at hand. This challenge should not take
you longer than 8 hours. Let us know if you have anyt questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attached is a csv file: flights.csv, which contains 3 months of data related to
airline performance from 2001.

Sample data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
date,    delay, distance, origin, destination
01010001,   14,      405, MCI,    MDW
01010530,  -11,      370, LAX,    PHX

Columns......:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date.........: date without year, only month, day, hour & minute are specified.
Delay........: Delay in minutes than scheduled time, negative delay means flight
               arrived earlier than scheduled time
Distance.....: Distance in miles
Origin.......: Flight origin airport
Destination..: Flight destination airport

Your job is to write code that will load in flights.csv and analyze the data
against the rules listed below. Your code should output the results into three files

1. best_performance.csv will contain a list of best performing flight records
   according to rules below.

   Best Perforamnce Rules:
   * The flight must have reached before scheduled time
   * It must have reached before scheduled time at least 2 times
   * The flight distance must be more than 400 miles

2. other_flights.csv will contain a list of all other flights

3. daily_best_flights.csv will contain the single best flight of the day,
   where delay is be minimum, distance is maximum and flight is in morning hours

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your code should be modular and reusable. Assume this is the first pass at a tool
to build on and maintain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonus points:
* Add an option to output json instead of csv
* Write unit tests
